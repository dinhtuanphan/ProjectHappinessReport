## 2019 World Happiness Report

- This is a fun project showing that I had so much free time to learn about data science
- The data source here is readily available on the internet, simply google it to have the latest data
- I built machine learning models to predict/classify countries based on the happiness score
- Algorithms used: multiple linear regression, model selections (best subset selection, forward stepwise selection, LASSO), classification (KNN, decision tree)
